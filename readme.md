<!-- Sometime u need to write ur code inside ur markdown to explain ur concept -->

for()
```

<!-- Example -->
```
for (let i=0; i < cars.length; i++) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; }
```

<!-- Example -->
```javascript
for (let i=0; i < cars.length; i++) { text += cars[i] + "<br>"; }

<!-- line 96 to 98 is code snippet -->
<!-- There is difference between writing an inline code and code snippet -->

<!-- Sometime u just need to explain just a word or print method or a function that u have written and you have to talk about it, hey i want to talk about anchor tag or let or a const keyword , in that u need to put 1 back tick before and after line or that keyword itself, then it will be highlighted -->

<!-- For example, u r expalining keyword let , u can put let in single back tick & let will change its colour-->

Hello `let` is a keyword

<!-- 3 back tick means u want to write code snippet which can be of more than one line, 1 back for keyword, may be u want to say this is a library, or this is a part of code snippet, so there we will be using the 1 back tick -->

<!-- u cannot manipulate size in markdown -->

<!-- To bring images from local storage -->

<!-- ./ & ../ for 1 dir back & 2 dir back respectively -->
